# Convert Worktree

Convert a git worktree into a regular local branch. Rebases onto the latest base branch, runs project cleanup, removes the worktree, and checks out the branch in the main workspace.

This skill replaces ExitWorktree. Do not call ExitWorktree after this skill runs.

## Steps

### 1. Verify context

Run these checks. Fail fast if any fail.

```bash
# Get main worktree path
MAIN_WORKTREE=$(git worktree list --porcelain 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's/worktree //')

# Confirm we're in a worktree (current dir differs from main worktree)
if [ "$MAIN_WORKTREE" = "$(pwd)" ] || [ -z "$MAIN_WORKTREE" ]; then
  # FAIL: "Not in a worktree. This skill only works from inside a worktree."
fi

# Confirm not detached HEAD
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ -z "$BRANCH" ]; then
  # FAIL: "Detached HEAD. Nothing to convert. Checkout a branch first."
fi

WORKTREE_PATH=$(pwd)
```

Resolve the default branch. Never hardcode `main` or `master`:
```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||')
if [ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
  git rev-parse --verify main >/dev/null 2>&1 && BASE_BRANCH=main || BASE_BRANCH=master
fi
```

Announce: "Converting worktree `<WORKTREE_PATH>` (branch `<BRANCH>`) → main workspace at `<MAIN_WORKTREE>`"

### 2. Preserve uncommitted work

Split preservation from history. Tracked modifications and content the user already staged are committed. Unstaged untracked files are stashed so they survive worktree removal without entering branch history (`.gitignore` is not a secret scanner, and a blanket `git add -A` can promote `.env` files, credentials, generated artifacts, or unrelated scratch into a commit that later workflows publish).

```bash
# Show what's there before touching anything
git status --short

STASHED_UNTRACKED=0
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  # Stage tracked modifications and deletions. Anything the user already
  # staged (including new files they explicitly `git add`ed) stays staged.
  git add -u

  # Commit if there's anything in the index. Untracked-and-unstaged files
  # are deliberately not in scope here.
  if [ -n "$(git diff --cached --name-only)" ]; then
    git commit -m "chore(worktree): preserve tracked changes during conversion"
  fi

  # Stash any remaining untracked files. The stash ref is repo-level, so it
  # survives worktree removal and is popped in the main workspace at step 5.
  if [ -n "$(git ls-files --others --exclude-standard)" ]; then
    git stash push --include-untracked -m "convert-worktree:untracked:$BRANCH"
    STASHED_UNTRACKED=1
  fi
fi
```

Capture the untracked paths from `git status --short` for the final report so the user knows exactly what was preserved outside history.

### 3. Project cleanup

Run while still in the worktree so project-specific variables (DB names, ports) resolve correctly.

```bash
# Convention-based: if Makefile has dev-stop, run it
if [ -f Makefile ] && grep -q '^dev-stop:' Makefile; then
  make dev-stop || echo "Warning: make dev-stop failed, continuing"
fi
```

Cleanup failure must not block the conversion.

### 4. Rebase onto latest base branch

```bash
# Fetch latest (skip if no origin remote)
git fetch origin "$BASE_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true

# Determine rebase target
if git rev-parse --verify "origin/$BASE_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  REBASE_TARGET="origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
else
  REBASE_TARGET="$BASE_BRANCH"
fi

# Check if already up-to-date
if git merge-base --is-ancestor "$REBASE_TARGET" HEAD 2>/dev/null; then
  # Already up-to-date, skip rebase
fi
```

Run rebase. Handle conflicts:

- **Lockfiles** (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`): accept theirs and stage:
  ```bash
  git checkout --theirs <lockfile>
  git add <lockfile>
  git rebase --continue
  ```
  Note: lockfile will be slightly stale. Remind user to run `npm install` (or equivalent) after checkout.

- **Code conflicts**: if rebase hits a conflict that isn't a lockfile, abort immediately:
  ```bash
  git rebase --abort
  ```
  Warn the user that the branch is un-rebased. Continue with the rest of the conversion.

Never block the conversion on rebase failure.

### 5. Remove worktree, checkout branch in main workspace

```bash
# Check main workspace is clean before attempting checkout
cd "$MAIN_WORKTREE"
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  # WARN: "Main workspace has uncommitted changes. Checkout may fail."
  # Ask user: proceed or abort?
fi

git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH" --force
git checkout "$BRANCH"

# Restore untracked files from step 2. They reappear as untracked in the
# main workspace, never entering branch history.
if [ "$STASHED_UNTRACKED" = "1" ]; then
  if ! git stash pop; then
    echo "WARN: could not auto-pop untracked stash. Inspect with 'git stash list'."
  fi
fi
```

### 6. Report

Print a summary:

```
Branch <BRANCH> checked out in <MAIN_WORKTREE>
  Rebase: <succeeded | skipped (already up-to-date) | failed (branch is un-rebased)>
  Cleanup: <ran make dev-stop | no cleanup target found | cleanup failed>
  <If untracked files were stashed: list each path under "Untracked (popped from stash, review before committing):">
  <If lockfiles were auto-resolved: "Run npm install (or equivalent) to update lockfiles">
```

## Rules

- **Never block on failure.** Rebase failure, cleanup failure, and lockfile conflicts are all warnings. The conversion always completes.
- **Never push, create PRs, delete branches, or merge.** Those are separate user decisions.
- **Cleanup before rebase.** Project cleanup needs worktree context (variables, paths). Rebase happens after.
- **Never auto-commit untracked files.** Tracked modifications and explicitly staged content go into the WIP commit; unstaged untracked files are stashed and re-popped in the main workspace. `.gitignore` is an exclusion list, not a secret scanner, so a blanket `git add -A` can leak `.env` files, credentials, or generated artifacts into history.
- **Detect the base branch dynamically.** Use `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, fall back to `main`, then `master`. Never hardcode the default branch name.
- If on the default branch or not in a worktree, warn and stop.
